# Connection Rules

## Description

This guide demonstrates how to control which input connectors are eligible to be connected with output connectors.
The feature validates the possibility of a connection and triggers an event if the connection is allowed.

## Example

::: ng-component <connection-rules></connection-rules> [height]="600"
[component.html] <<< https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Foblex/f-flow/main/projects/f-examples/connectors/connection-rules/connection-rules.html
[component.ts] <<< https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Foblex/f-flow/main/projects/f-examples/connectors/connection-rules/connection-rules.ts
[component.scss] <<< https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Foblex/f-flow/main/projects/f-examples/connectors/connection-rules/connection-rules.scss
[common.scss] <<< https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Foblex/f-flow/main/projects/f-examples/_flow-common.scss
